# Memory Card Game
This is a card game in which you match pairs of identical cards together. All the cards are hidden at the start, but clicking on them reveals each card. You must remember each specific card's place in order to find its match among the other cards. Only two cards can be visible at a time.
The objective of the game is to match all of the available cards together to win.

### Starting the game

To begin the game, click on a card and the timer will start.

### Rating system
The amount of stars is dependent on how many moves you have taken so far. The stars will change as you keep clicking more cards.  

22 moves or less is the best score of three stars. 

23 through 45 moves is two stars. 

Over 45 moves is a one star rating.
